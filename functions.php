						<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">When my terrier became suddenly ill on October 11, 2013, there was still time enough to bring him to his regular vet who has 8-5 hours. She gave him iv fluids under his skin, an antibiotic injection, and ran some bloodwork, which showed slighlty elevated liver numbers, but other than that he was fine. That little trip cost me $240.00, but I was optimistic that he would not get any worse. I stayed by his side for 8 hours, almost willing him to feel better, but the severe diarrhea was dehydrating him at a rapid rate. By 2am I knew he had to be brought to the emeregency clinic of pitt county in NC.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">Thankfully, the veterinarian on call that night was caring and sympathetic.  She treated my 12 year old terrier as if he was hers. When an animal is that sick, the smallest kindness makes all the difference. I was asked that night to make a deposit of $600.00, and the signs all around me told me if I did not pay the $600.00, I could not get emergency care for my dog. Fortunately, I had managed to put a little in savings for the last fice years, and was able to pay them.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">The next morning, (5hrs later) I was told to come and transport him to his regular vet, because this clinic only operated from 6pm to 7am on week-days, and on the week-ends. My dog was so limp he was lifeless, and I was met at the door by my regular vet assistants. They took him and said they would continue the iv solution he was getting - he had an iv catheter in his arm. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">That night, I had to arrive at 5:30pm to transport him back to the emergency clinic. He was still critically ill and didnt seem to care who handled him. When i arrived at the Emergency CLinic, I was told I had four and one half minutes to wait before they would let Bennie, my terrier and me, inside. I was astounded. I watched them move around inside the office, almost ambling, as if they had nothing in particular to do. It was a cold night, so I left my car running to keep Bennie warm.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;"> If they had things to do before opening the door, could they not have at least let us sit inside where it was warm? I suddenly was afraid. If people could be so callous as to let a critically ill dog sit outside for four and one half minutes, how sympathetic could they be to his situation? When I was finally let inside the door, I was met by unfriendly assistants and a brusque veterinarian. Not the one we had the night before. This one, I would learn, was the owener of this business, and she was no friendlier than her associates. I let them take Bennie from my arms and walk away with him. I did not have the confidence I had the night before. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">Then I was told I would need to pay an additional $550.00. So far, they had Bennie a total of 5 hours, for which I paid $600.00, and now I was being told I would need to pay another $550.00 if he was going to be treated any further. You can't argue in a situation like that. Your dog's life is being held in the balance. I reluctantly paid the $550.00, a total of $1,150.00 for 2am to 7am, and for his continued care from that Friday night at 6pm forward. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">The next day I went to see Bennie, and he was starting to appear more alert. He would not eat, they told me, so I drove to petsmart and bought some of his favorite canned food. They did not tell me that they would only let him eat Purina EM, so the trip was wasted. When I returned with the food, they took the bag and put his name on it, then told me I owed $140.50 more, which I was agian paid. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">He had now been at the clinic from 2am - 7am on the 11th,(5 hrs) and 6pm to midnight the night of the 11th(6 hrs). From midnight on the 12th until 7am the 12th (7 hrs) from 7a-7pm (12hrs) on the 12th, and from from 7pm to midnight the 12th,(5 hrs) and from sunday midnight the 13th until 8pm the 13th (20 hrs). A total of 55 hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;"> I tried to see Bennie on Sunday, but they were inundated with crital care cases, and so I left, hoping that Bennie was holding his own. On 7pm Sunday I got a call from Dr Mackenzie telling me to come and pick Bennie up. I was elated. I drove to the clinic with warm blankets to wrap him in, and was told to check out first. THe assistant told me I had a $65.00 credit coming back to me. I was so happy I was not asked for more money. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">But the next day I receiveed a call from Dr Mackenzie telling me there had been a mix up with another client, and I was not supposed to get a $65 credit, I was actually supposed to pay <strong>$450.50 MORE</strong>. Bringing his 55 hours to a whopping <strong>$1,678.45.</strong> I asked for an itemized bill to be faxed to me, and there were some glaring charges that did not seem justified. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">To begin with, they charged $80.00 for up to 24 hrs of nursing care. Well, I had been charged $320.00 for that care...thats 4 units of 24 hr care at $80.00 each. That would be 96 hours of nursing care. Bennie was there for 55 hours. Not 96 hours. When I questioned this, they explained that is how they bill nursing, whether I agree with it or not. Well, I don't agree with it. If my dog was there for 55 hours, I only expect to pay for 55 hours of nursing care.</span></p><p>And I also started to wonder how many other people in Pitt County have wondered whether their emergency clinic bills have been extraordinarily excessive.</p><p>If you have used the Pet Emergency Clinic of Pitt County and feel your bills are too excessive, please use the contact form on this site to contact me.</p>

						<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">If you live in North Carolina and and watch or listen to or read the news, chances are good that you have heard of the antics of our governer, Pat McCrory, and his involvment in the state's Dept of Health and Human Services. 100 of NC's department of Social Services use a computer system called NCFAST to process assistance applications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">For the last 6 months, this program has failed, miserably, and at one point Pitt County Social Services had 1,000 pending applications, and families were not receiving their food stamps.</span></p>

						<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">Do you like to record movies on your DVR )Digital Video Recorder?  Do you wish you had more room to save more movies?  Here is a neat trick that will more than DOUBLE the amount of movies, talk shows, sitcoms, etc. you can save on your DVR box:  </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">Record the show on a non-High Definition channel. I have cable, and for every High Definition channel, there is a "sister" channel that is not in high definition. For instance, I like to watch TCM movies that broadcast in High Definition on channel 215. But the non-high definition channel is channel 15. Same movies, same broadcasts, but one is in high definition and the other is not. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-106" title="couch potato" src="http://skeeping.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/couch-potato.jpg" alt="watching TV" width="266" height="190" /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">If I want to record a movie, I record the movie on channel 15, the non-High Def channel. The difference in the size of a standard broadcast and a High-Def broadcast is substantial.  This is what allows you to record so many standard shows as opposed to the High-Def shows.  The Disney channel is broadcast in High-Definition on channel 214, but the non-High definition channel is 14. Same principle - if the children want a Disney movie recorded, I record it on channel 14. The playback is not going to be as sharp as high-definition shows are, but it's a fair trade off.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 14px;">When recording HD shows, I was able to save 8 or 9 at a time. If I record them on non-High Definition channels, I can record up to twenty at one time! Proving it always helps to think out of-the-box. The "High Def" box!</span></p>
